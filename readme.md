# Mini Summary

Formulas, report, and notes for making my life easier. (I hope, it depends if I keep working on it or not.)

## Contents

The file is divided into two sections:

1. **Integrals**: This section lists common integral formulas. Each formula is presented in the form $\int f(x) dx = F(x) + c$, where $f(x)$ is the function being integrated, $F(x)$ is the antiderivative, and $c$ is the constant of integration.

2. **Derivatives**: This section lists common derivative formulas. Each formula is presented in the form $f'(x) = F(x)$, where $f'(x)$ is the derivative of the function $f(x)$, and $F(x)$ is the derivative.

## Usage

To view the results, download the file from releases and open it in a PDF viewer.

Otherwise, you can clone the repository and compile the file yourself. To compile the file, you will need [Typst](https://typst.app/), then run the following command:

```sh
typst compile src/main.typ
```
