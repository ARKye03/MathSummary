# Mini Summary

Formulas, report, and notes for making my life easier. (I hope, it depends if I keep working on it or not.)

## Contents

The file is divided into two sections:

1. **Integrals**: This section lists common integral formulas. Each formula is presented in the form $\u{222B}f(x) dx = F(x) + c$, where $f(x)$ is the function being integrated, $F(x)$ is the antiderivative, and $c$ is the constant of integration.

2. **Derivatives**: This section lists common derivative formulas. Each formula is presented in the form $f'(x) = F(x)$, where $f'(x)$ is the derivative of the function $f(x)$, and $F(x)$ is the derivative.

## Usage

To view the contents of this file, you will need a viewer that can render `typst` files. Once you have such a viewer, you can open the file in it to see the formulas.

## Contributing

If you find any errors in the formulas, or if you have any formulas that you would like to add, please feel free to make a pull request.
